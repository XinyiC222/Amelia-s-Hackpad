# Amelia-s-Hackpad

My personal Macropad that would help me open up apps, turn volume up and down, and do other cool things. I am using: 4 SW_Push, and 1 rotary encoder, 2 neopixels, and a Seed XIAO RP2040. This also uses KMK firmware.

<h1>FEATURES:</h1>
- EC11 Rotary encoder
- 2 SK6812 MINI-E LED
- 4 Switches/Keys

<h1>BOM</h1>:
- 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
- 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder
- 4x Cherry MX Swithces
- 4x DSA Keycaps
- 2x SK6812 MINI-E LED
- 2x M3x20mm BHCS screws
- 4x M3 Hex Steel nuts
- 1x Case(two 3d printed parts, top and bottom)


Here is my final designs!

<h1>PCB:</h1>
<p>I used KiCad to make my PCB board. The silkscreen is just random unicodes I found!! </p>

<p>I added a bit of tilt to make it easy to use.</p>

<h1>Firmware:</h1>

This macropad uses KMK.
- The rotary encoder changes the volume and mutes/unmutes.
- The 4 keys opens different apps by using spotlight search(MAC)
- The mini LED is green when you turn it the device on, then it slowly fades in and out.
